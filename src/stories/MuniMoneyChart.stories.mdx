# Notes

- basic chart - four years, one municipality, no comparisons, no medians
- comparisons:
   - initially basic chart
   - demonstration button - three additional munis' data added - chart transitions to show all
   - demonstration button - change the selection of munis - chart transitions to show different set of comparison munis
- medians:
   - initially basic chart
   - add medians
   - change medians
   - when the medians are changed, the line moves in animation
